## 🚀 Our Mission

Our mission is to create a high-level, open-source, and experimental framework for stylized non-human ethical vocal synthesis. 

The **[Alizarin Engine](https://github.com/ALIZARINENGINE/AlizarinEngine)** is a project designed to generate multiple types of voice products—including real-time TTS, AI singing, and concatenative singing—all from a single, 100% synthetic voice source. We are focused on empowering creators with powerful tools to author entirely new synthetic voices, giving them deep control to produce heavily stylized and unique timbres, such as those inspired by retro speech synthesis.

## 📖 Get Started

Whether you're a developer, a voice creator, or just curious, here's where you'll want to go to learn more:

* **[AlizarinEngine Repository](https://github.com/ALIZARINENGINE/AlizarinEngine)**: This is the main project. Dive into the code, check out the demos, and see how it works.
* **[USAGE_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/ALIZARINENGINE/AlizarinEngine/blob/main/USAGE_GUIDE.md)**: **Please read this first!** It contains the full ethical terms of use, license, and usage rules.
* **[MULTILINGUAL_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/ALIZARINENGINE/AlizarinEngine/blob/main/MULTILINGUAL_GUIDE.md)**: Learn how to use our RVC-hybrid workflow to create voicebanks in new languages.

## 💖 Character Rights & Special Requests

This section covers the usage rights for our official characters (like the Alizarin Engine Voice) and their associated IP. While our engine is open-source, our official characters are our brand, and their use is more strictly controlled.

**Non-commercial artistic fan works are encouraged!** For all other uses, please see the **"Special Requests" process (detailed in our `USAGE_GUIDE.md`)** if you wish to:

* Request permission to use an official character's name for song credits (e.g., "Song featuring ALIZARIN").
* Inquire about a commercial license for using the character's name or artwork (e.g., on merchandise or album covers).
* Propose an official collaboration or addition to one of our main, official voicebanks.
* Request a one time exception for a use case restricted by our standard character rights (like R-18 content).

## 💬 Join the Community

Our official Discord is the central hub for our community. It's the best place to get support, find collaborators for your voice, and share what you've created.

* **[Join the Discord Server](https://discord.gg/6c4yTrMqRt)**
* **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ALIZARINENGINE/AlizarinEngine/discussions)**: The best place for Q&A, persistent feature requests, and long-form help.

* **[EULA / Terms of Use (`USAGE_GUIDE.md`)](https://github.com/ALIZARINENGINE/AlizarinEngine/blob/main/USAGE_GUIDE.md)**: Governs the **use** of the engine and any voices you create.
* **[Core Code License (`LICENSE`)](https://github.com/ALIZARINENGINE/AlizarinEngine/blob/main/LICENSE)**: The LGPLv3 license that governs the **software code** itself.
* **[Third-Party Licenses](https://github.com/ALIZARINENGINE/AlizarinEngine/blob/main/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md)**: A list of licenses for all third-party components used by this project.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

We are actively developing the Alizarin Engine and welcome collaborators of all kinds!

### For Developers:
Check our roadmap and open issues to see where you can help.

* **[See our Roadmap (Projects)](https://github.com/ALIZARINENGINE/AlizarinEngine/projects)**: View the high-level plan, see what's in progress, and find out what's coming next.
* **[Check Open Issues](https://github.com/ALIZARINENGINE/AlizarinEngine/issues)**: Find bug reports and feature needs. This is the best place to start contributing code.

### We Need Linguists & Data Curators!
This project's success depends on more than just code. We are actively seeking help in the following areas:

* **Native Language Support:** Do you have expertise in phonetics for a non-English language? We need help building the phoneme maps, accent rules, and synthesis data for native engine support.
* **RVC Data Oversight:** We need community members to help oversee and manage the RVC hybrid workflow, helping connect VAs with creators and ensuring ethical guidelines are followed.

If you have this expertise, please introduce yourself on our **[Discord](https://discord.gg/6c4yTrMqRt)**!
